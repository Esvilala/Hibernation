**Hibernation 1.0**

--------------------------

This Itemfilter for Path of Exile 3.0 The Fall of Oriath is a very compact, strict high tier mapping filter.
**Do not use this filter untill you can compfortly sustain Tier 7 or 8 maps!**

It will hide all white maps, bad layout yellow maps, bad base rares and much more. It will how ever show everything important, including all shaped maps and potentially valuable items.

There are no other variations of this filter as of now, but you can very easily edit hte filter yourself to show or hide what you need.
