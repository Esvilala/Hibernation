**Hibernation 1.0**

This Itemfilter for Path of Exile 3.0 The Fall of Oriath is a very compact, strict high tier mapping filter. **Do not use this filter untill you can compfortly sustain Tier 7 or 8 maps!**

It will hide all white maps, bad layout yellow maps, bad base rares and much more. It will how ever show everything important and potentially valuable.
