**Hibernation 2.0**

--------------------------

This Itemfilter for Path of Exile 3.1 War for the Atlas is a very compact, strict high tier mapping filter.
**!!Do not use this filter until you can comfortly sustain Tier 7 or 8 maps!!**

It will hide some lesser currency, all white maps, bad layout yellow maps, bad base rares and much more. It will how ever show everything important, including all shaped maps and potentially valuable items.

There are no other variations of this filter as of now, but you can very easily edit the filter yourself to show or hide what you need.
